<h1>About Volleyball!</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Volleyball  is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net.</li>
  <li>The sport originated  in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the  U.S. </li>
  <li>There are  800 million players worldwide who play Volleyball at least once a week. </li>
  <li>The object of the  game is for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on  the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own  court. </li>
  <li>The ball is put into  play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the  net to the opponent's court.</li>
  <li>A team is  allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to  return it to the opponent's court. </li>
  <li>A player is not  allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block. </li>
  <li>The rally  continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes &quot;out&quot; or a  team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault. The team  winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). </li>
  <li>When the  receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its  players rotate one position clockwise. </li>
  <li>The best of  three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be  won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage  (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that  first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).</li>
